Overview

This repo contains R scripts and an RMarkdown file used to analyze data on the guns in Valorant and their statistics. It uses data obtained by Valorant. The purpose of this report is to assess the difference between the two most popular weapons in the game, and discuss how those differences influence when each gun should be used. The final report can be viewed here.

More information on the dataset can be found on Valorant's website.
